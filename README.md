📘 SmartTreadmillSimulator
This Java program simulates a smart treadmill workout using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

🧬 Inheritance: Treadmill inherits from ElectronicAppliance.

🤝 Aggregation: A User is passed into the treadmill but exists independently.

🧩 Composition: The treadmill contains a Motor, created and managed internally.

🔁 Polymorphism (Threads): Each workout phase (Warm-up, Running, Cooldown) runs in its own thread via Runnable.

🏃‍♂️ Workout Simulation:
Warm-up – 3 seconds

Running – 5 seconds

Cooldown – 2 seconds

The program guides a user named Ali (21) through this workout, showing how OOP can model real-world behavior in a simple, interactive simulation.
